Right now, my initial idea is to make a story about a cat based off of my best friend megan. 
It will either be megan as a cat in a different life or she turns into one. She loves cats so I will send her the game once I make it.
Some of the tasks will be:
First she meets a genie (named lindsey) she desiced if she wants to talk to the genie 
The Genie offers her a wish- she decides if swhe wants it granted 
Once the Genie gives her the wish she turns into a cat 
She decides if she wants to run to a shelter to get adopted or be a wild cat and explore 
Those are some of my initial ideas


ok so i didnt do this at all i made it based off of Sav in out class she was a green jelly monster she thought it was silly
