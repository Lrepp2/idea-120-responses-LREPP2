The internet was once a box in our homes,

a desktop shared with family.


What once was static is now all-consuming,

from smartwatches to phones that never stop.


Lost in the potential of interactive worlds,

we overlook how immersed we really are. 



In the rush to engage, we forget-

how we turned from passive consumers,

to active participants,

to entangled prisoners of the screen.
